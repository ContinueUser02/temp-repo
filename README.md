Review

1. Repository: You can own repositories individually, or you can share ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.
2. Branch: Allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.
3. Commit: Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch.
